## Purpose

A application where a user can write and save notes that need to be completed.

## Requirements

Note-taking application
-WHEN I open the Note Taker then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

- WHEN I click on the link to the notes page then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- WHEN I click on the Save icon then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column then that note appears in the right-hand column
- WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
